## CIFAR10ImageClassification

 In this project, I aim to implement
 multiple neural network architectures to perform image clas
sification on a randomized version of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
 This dataset comprises 50,000 training images and 10,000
 testing images, each of size 32 Ã— 32, spanning 10 distinct
 classes. I trained a total of five models for this study, which
 are as follows:
 1) Basic Neural Network
 2) Improved Neural Network
 3) ResNet
 4) ResNeXt
 5) DenseNet
